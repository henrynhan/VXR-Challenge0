# Simple Breakout Clone
I created a simple breakout clone by following a 
[tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCqOnchV4V0) 
by Impheniza. 

This game was made for Virtual and Mixed Reality class at 
Mississippi State University for challenge 0, which was to 
create either a simple game or virtual environment. I 
chose to create a simple game since I did not have access 
to VR equipment at the time.
